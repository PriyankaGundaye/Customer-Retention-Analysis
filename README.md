# Customer-Retention-Analysis
Leveraged Power BI to analyze customer churn data for a telecom company, identifying patterns in customer demographics,
account details, and service usage that were correlated with churn rates. Filtered and compared data to highlight trends between churned and retained customers, utilizing bar charts, pie charts,
and tables to visually present insights. Discovered that customers with fiber optic service and month-to-month contracts had the highest churn rates, leading
to recommendations for retention strategies focused on contract up-sells and increasing customer tenure.
